    <p>We collect personal information from you, including information about your:
      name, contact information, interactions with us and allergies and relevant health concerns.</p>

    <p>We collect your personal information in order to:
      confirm our guests' reservations, and contact them if a booking ever needs to be amended or discussed,
      be made aware of any allergies before the booking date- to ensure there is no cross contamination in the kitchen.
    </p>

    <p>Providing some information is optional.
      However, if you choose not to enter your name and phone number, we'll be unable to confirm the booking, due to
      excessive cancellations.</p>

    <p>We keep your information safe by storing it in encrypted files and only allowing the owners of the restaurant to
      access it to confirm bookings.</p>

    <p>You have the right to ask for a copy of any personal information we hold about you, and to ask for it to be
      corrected if you think it is wrong.
      If you’d like to ask for a copy of your information, or to have it corrected, please contact us at
      contact@haukai_restaurant.co.nz, or 09 401 4019, or write to us at 1 Island Street, Kerikeri, Bay of Islands.</p>
